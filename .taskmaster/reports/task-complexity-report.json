		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation Review System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation review system into subtasks covering status checking, change detection, template validation, manual override functionality, and output formatting. For each subtask, detail the implementation approach and user experience considerations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex operations: checking file status, detecting changes, validating templates, and providing manual overrides. The rich output formatting and detailed user feedback requirements add significant complexity."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation Validation System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation validation system into subtasks covering file existence checking, change detection, template validation, diagram validation, error reporting, and pre-commit hook integration. For each subtask, detail the implementation approach and validation criteria.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it combines multiple validation steps, integrates with git, and must provide detailed error messages. The validation logic is sophisticated, requiring checks for template content, diagrams, and file relationships."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Template Detection Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the template detection logic into subtasks covering placeholder detection, diagram validation, section content analysis, and comprehensive validation rules. For each subtask, provide detailed implementation steps and test cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires sophisticated content analysis using regex and string manipulation. The complexity comes from detecting various template elements, validating diagram content, and analyzing section completeness with multiple criteria."
