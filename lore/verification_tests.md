# verify_installation.py - Context Documentation

## Purpose

This module provides lightweight verification testing for Dungeon Master core functionality without requiring external dependencies. It serves as a quick sanity check that can be run immediately after installation to ensure all components are working correctly. The verification tests focus on the most critical functionality paths and provide confidence that the system is ready for use in production environments.

## Usage Summary

**File Location**: `tests/verify_installation.py`

**Primary Use Cases**:

- Quick verification that all modules can be imported correctly
- Test core parser functionality with sample decorator detection
- Validate template generation and placeholder detection
- Verify document validation logic with realistic examples
- Provide immediate feedback on installation success or failure

**Key Dependencies**:

- `sys`: Python interpreter access and path manipulation for importing local modules
- `os`: Operating system interface for file creation and cleanup
- `pathlib.Path`: Modern path handling for temporary file operations
- Standard library only: Designed to avoid external dependencies for maximum portability

## Key Functions or Classes

**Key Functions**:

- **test_imports()**: Validates that all Dungeon Master modules can be imported and reports version information
- **test_parser()**: Tests decorator extraction and context document name validation with sample content
- **test_template_generator()**: Creates sample files, generates templates, and validates placeholder detection
- **test_validation()**: Tests document validation logic with both complete and incomplete templates
- **test_cli_functionality()**: Verifies that CLI entry points can be imported and are callable
- **test_directory_creation()**: Validates output directory creation and management
- **main()**: Test runner that executes all verification tests with detailed reporting

## Usage Notes

- Tests create temporary files that are automatically cleaned up after testing
- All test operations are designed to be side-effect free and safe to run repeatedly
- The verification focuses on "happy path" scenarios rather than exhaustive edge case testing
- Tests provide clear success/failure indicators with descriptive error messages
- The module can be run standalone or integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated verification
- Memory and disk usage is minimal, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments

## Dependencies & Integration

This verification module provides confidence in the overall system health:

- **Tests**: Core functionality across all major Dungeon Master modules
- **Uses**: Only standard library modules for maximum compatibility
- **Integration approach**:
  1. Import verification ensures all modules load correctly
  2. Functional testing validates core workflows work end-to-end
  3. File operations testing ensures I/O reliability
  4. CLI testing confirms user interface availability
  5. Cleanup ensures no test artifacts remain

The verification tests serve as a bridge between development testing and production deployment confidence.
