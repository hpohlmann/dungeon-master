# Product Requirements Document: Testing Structure Revision

## Executive Summary

The current Dungeon Master testing infrastructure is contaminating production-facing documentation by creating test-generated files in the main `.lore` directory instead of a dedicated development directory. This defeats the purpose of maintaining clean separation between production and development data, making it impossible to distinguish between actual project documentation and test artifacts.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **Production Contamination**: Test runs are creating numerous files in the `.lore` directory that appear in production-facing output
2. **Clean Separation Failure**: No clear boundary between development/test data and production documentation
3. **Cluttered Output**: Test-generated files are appearing in the main Sora file and other production documentation views
4. **Development Experience**: Developers cannot easily distinguish between real documentation and test artifacts

### Impact
- Production documentation becomes unreliable and cluttered
- Reduced confidence in the documentation system
- Difficulty in maintaining clean project state
- Potential confusion for new developers and stakeholders

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete Isolation**: Ensure all test-generated files are scoped exclusively to `.lore.dev`
2. **Zero Leakage**: Prevent any test artifacts from appearing in `.lore` or production outputs
3. **Clean Separation**: Maintain clear boundaries between development and production environments
4. **Reliable Testing**: Preserve full testing capabilities while isolating output

### Secondary Goals
1. **Easy Cleanup**: Enable simple removal of all test artifacts
2. **Development Workflow**: Support efficient development and debugging workflows
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure clean builds in continuous integration environments
4. **Documentation Quality**: Maintain high-quality production documentation

## Requirements

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Changes

#### Configuration System
```python
# Test-specific configuration override
TEST_CONFIG_OVERRIDE = {
    "loreDirectory": ".lore.dev",
    "validateOnCommit": False,
    "verboseOutput": True
}
```

#### Test Base Classes
```python
class IsolatedTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """Base test class with automatic .lore.dev isolation."""
    
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        # Set test environment configuration
        # Create .lore.dev directory
        # Apply test-specific settings
        pass
    
    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        # Clean up .lore.dev directory
        # Restore original configuration
        pass
```

#### Directory Management
```python
def get_test_lore_directory():
    """Returns .lore.dev for test environments."""
    return Path(".lore.dev")

def ensure_test_isolation():
    """Validates test environment is properly isolated."""
    # Verify .lore.dev is being used
    # Confirm .lore is not being modified
    pass
```

### File Structure Changes

```
project/
├── .lore/                    # Production documentation only
│   └── (production files)
├── .lore.dev/               # Test-generated files only (gitignored)
│   ├── examples/
│   ├── test-fixtures/
│   └── (test artifacts)
├── tests/

```

### Configuration Changes

#### Environment Detection
```python
def is_test_environment():
    """Detect if running in test environment."""
    return (
        "pytest" in sys.modules or
        "unittest" in sys.modules or
        os.getenv("DM_TEST_MODE") == "true"
    )
```

#### Dynamic Configuration
```python
def get_lore_directory(config=None):
    """Get appropriate lore directory based on environment."""
    if is_test_environment():
        return ".lore.dev"
    return config.get("loreDirectory", ".lore")
```

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success Metrics
1. **Zero Contamination**: No test-generated files appear in `.lore` directory
2. **Complete Isolation**: All test files created in `.lore.dev` only
